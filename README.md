# Parallel Ray Tracer

A CLI tool that can render raytraced scenes from abstract geometrical data.
Currently, it accepts a scene file and a jpeg file to output.

`./raytrace scenes/spheres.scene out.jpg`

This was originally a homework assignment for CSCI 420 Computer Graphics at USC.
However, I added some additional features (parallel compute w/ OpenMP and anti-aliasing) for extra credit.
